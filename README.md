Minimalistic desktop client for RememberTheMilk.com

This is basic web browser wrapper, that removes all toolbars and leaves only tasks list and adds some responsiveness to website. At small width it only displays task list but if you you make it wide it will display additional tools. All customizations are made via JavaScript with jQuery. Script is saved to registry, press F12 to debug and customize it.
